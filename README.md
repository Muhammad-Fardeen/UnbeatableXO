# UnbeatableXO

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, featuring an unbeatable AI opponent that employs the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the repository** or download the `UnbeatableXO.py` file to your local machine.

2. Ensure that you have **Python** installed on your system. The code is compatible with **Python 3**.

3. Open a **terminal** or **command prompt** and navigate to the directory where you saved the `UnbeatableXO.py` file.

4. **Run the game** by typing the following command:

   ```bash
   python UnbeatableXO.py

5. The game will display the Tic Tac Toe board with numbered positions 0-8.

6. To make a move, enter the number corresponding to the position where you want to place your "X". For example, to place your "X" in the top-left corner, enter 0.

7. The AI will then make its move and place an "O" on the board.

8. Continue taking turns with the AI until the game ends. The game ends when either player wins, or the board is full, resulting in a draw.

Enjoy playing against the unbeatable AI!

## Unbeatable AI
The AI employs the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make optimal moves.
It explores all possible moves and counter-moves, assuming both players make the best moves possible. The AI then selects the best move that leads to either a win or a draw. 
As a result, the AI will never lose if both players play optimally.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to reach out and enjoy the unbeatable Tic Tac Toe experience! ðŸ˜Š
